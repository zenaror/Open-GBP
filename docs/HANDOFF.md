# Open-GBP Project Handoff

## Purpose

This document is a **navigation and state index**. It is not evidence, and it
does not replace `docs/research/EVIDENCE.md`, `docs/research/HARDWARE_TESTS.md`
or any design document. Every conclusion below points at the source that owns
it; when this file and a source disagree, **the source wins** and the divergence
gets recorded.

Read `AGENTS.md` first.

## State baseline

```text
STATE BASELINE COMMIT   6f4eb0a9525cb0bd4aca502711bdd336ed218c0d
```

**What that means, precisely:** it is the **last commit whose scientific and
operational state was audited before this handoff snapshot was written**. It is
*not* "the expected current HEAD", and it is deliberately not this file's own
commit — a document cannot contain the hash of the commit that adds it. Expect
HEAD to be at least one commit ahead: the one carrying this text.

LAST PHYSICAL EVIDENCE INGESTED

```

### Staleness check — run this before trusting anything below

This file is **not automatically true because it exists**. Before relying on the
"current state" section:

```sh
git rev-parse HEAD
git status --short
git log --oneline $(sed -n 's/^STATE BASELINE COMMIT *//p' docs/HANDOFF.md)..HEAD
```

If that range contains commits, read them and decide whether any changes the
scientific or operational state. If it does, this handoff may be **STALE**:
reconcile against the authoritative sources first, and never update this file
silently before doing so.

## Mandatory read order

## Current physical delivery route

```

The **canonical** artifact is the source authority and is reproducible from this
repository. The **derived** artifact exists only for physical delivery, is never
committed, and never replaces the canonical one. No proprietary bytes enter the
repository at any point.

## Frozen contracts

Changing any of these means a **new version**, never an edit.

| contract | frozen at | definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OGBPSEQ1 v5** | physically produced; v2/v3/v4 are historical and frozen with their known defects | `src/gbp/gbp_vstatedump.h`, `tools/vstate.py` |
| **OGBPCOL1 v1** | frozen at the implementation checkpoint `e10423c`; `cert_rec` is **40** bytes | `src/gbp/gbp_vcoldump.h`, `tools/vcolor.py` |
| **`color-0001` analysis contract** | frozen at `bfbca70`; full-raw A/B/C byte equality. It refused `color-0001` and that verdict is permanent — `tools/vcolor.py` gains no option that could change it | `tools/vcolor.py`, `HARDWARE_TESTS.md` §V3.25 |
| **`color-0002` analysis contract** | pre-registered before the run it judges; consumed-word equality over 38 400 words, bit 15 included. Changing it after `color-0002` has run requires **`color-0003`** | `tools/vcolor2.py`, `HARDWARE_TESTS.md` §V4 |

## Exact physical artifacts

**A rebuilt binary does not inherit physical status.** This project embeds the
commit identity in its images, so the same source at another commit produces a
different hash. Match the SHA-256 before saying "physically tested".

The colour run's device log records the commit and the build id, **not** a DOL
hash, so `cc88e4c4…` is the build tree's hash at the declared commit `9d8302d`.
Rebuild with `make build` and compare `build/poc/gbp-video-color-probe/build-info.txt`
before calling any DOL the tested artifact; `build/swiss/11-color/boot.dol` is a
byte copy of it, not a second identity.

**`color-0001` can no longer be built from HEAD**, and that is deliberate: the
POC now declares `color-0002`. A run that has already happened should not be
silently reproducible under its own id. Its DOL hash above is what the record
keeps.

**The hash above belongs to the last commit before this handoff was written**,
because the commit identity is embedded in the image and a hash recorded in this
file can only ever be the previous commit's. Rebuild, read
`build/poc/gbp-video-stream-probe/build-info.txt`, and confirm the commit there
carries no `-dirty` suffix before calling any DOL the candidate.

**`color-0002`'s hash is exact, not inferred.** It was built clean at commit
`39f1980` before the run, with no `-dirty` suffix, and the device log declares the
same commit and build id. That is the strongest identity link any physical run in
this project has, and it is the pattern to repeat: build, read
`build/poc/<poc>/build-info.txt`, confirm the commit matches HEAD and carries no
`-dirty` suffix, and record that hash with the run. Hardware is never tested with
a dirty build (`CLAUDE.md` §18).

## Open questions

- ~~**U-GBP-011** — the VIDEO colour bit order~~ — **CLOSED 2026-09-18** by
  `color-0002`. The window exchanges the two outer 5-bit groups relative to the
  AGB framebuffer, so the references' GX RGB5A3 reading is the displayed colour.
  Two residuals stay open and were never part of that item: bit 15's origin
  (U-GBP-034) and the bytes 0/2 deviations (U-GBP-029).
- **U-GBP-034** — what sets bit 15 of the VIDEO pixel word, and can it appear
  anywhere but the first pixel of a frame? The AGB wrote zero there and the
  delivered word has it set, so the bit is added on the path; what sets it is
  not established. Not blocking.
- **U-GBP-029** — are the byte-0 / byte-2 deviations block data or a read-path
  artifact? `color-0001` is the strongest test so far (a non-uniform picture,
  every deviation confined to bytes 0 and 2, none in 1 or 3) and still not
  decisive.
- **U-GBP-033** — what mechanism produces semantic non-uniformity among the
  eight replicas of the IRQ window. Three physical runs corroborate the
  *policy*; none explains the *cause*.
- ~~Whether the fixed 5000 ms pre-handler wait is sufficient~~ — **ANSWERED**
  2026-09-18: sufficient for this stimulus at this position (GBP-HW-120). The
  claim is that duration and that position, nothing more.
- What the Game Boy Player does with PI masked for **longer** than 5 s at that
  position. Only 5 s was exercised.

## Current blocker / current question

> **The first supervised physical smoke of the exact `stream-0002` artifact.
> §V5.28 re-audited it and the classification is DECISION A: SAFE ENOUGH FOR
> FIRST SUPERVISED PHYSICAL SMOKE.**

Three audits have now read this experiment. The third (§V5.28) found no defect in
the service path, none in the ownership machine and none in the teardown; every
safety property it set out to check was proved. It found eight items, one of
which changes how the run's report must be read and none of which is a hardware
risk.

### The known reporting condition — R1, pre-registered before physical execution

`display_selftest()` presents one synthetic frame before the capture opens, and
its success path calls `gbp_vqueue_note_presented()`. That frame never passed
through the queue, so `consumer_frames_converted` was never incremented, and
`gbp_vqueue_balanced()` carries a **deterministic +1 presentation offset** for the
whole run. The candidate binary already demonstrates it: under Dolphin, with no
Game Boy Player attached, it prints
`presented=1 … counters DO NOT BALANCE`.

```text
PRE-REGISTERED, BEFORE PHYSICAL EXECUTION:

  stream-0002 WILL print `counters DO NOT BALANCE`. That is R1 and it is NOT a
  FAIL. The identity to evaluate for the first physical run is

      consumer_frames_converted == (consumer_frames_presented - SELFTEST.xfb)
                                 + consumer_slot_overrun

  where SELFTEST.xfb is the field the run itself prints on the SELFTEST line.
  Every other clause of §V5.21 is evaluated unchanged. If the CORRECTED identity
  does not hold, that IS a FAIL.
```

```text
R1 IS      a REPORTING defect. One counter in the CONSUMER domain is written by
           the pre-probe self-test, which is not a queue frame.
R1 IS NOT  a service defect, an ownership defect or a timing defect. The device
           cannot observe it.

RAW COUNTERS REMAIN AUTHORITATIVE. Every counter in STREAMSRC, STREAMCONS,
           STREAMOWN, STREAMGX, STREAMPUMP, STREAMPUMPT and STREAMPACE is printed
           individually and is unaffected. `gbp_vqueue_balanced()` is a DERIVED
           predicate, and it is the only thing the offset touches.

THIS CORRECTION WAS DEFINED BEFORE PHYSICAL EXECUTION — §V5.28.10 and §V5.28.14,
           commit `f179393` and the commit carrying this text, both before any
           physical run. It is a pre-registration and may not be re-derived after
           seeing a result.
```

### Rules that hold until the first run exists

```text
ARTIFACT IDENTITY IS UNCHANGED AND FROZEN
    build id  stream-0002
    commit    2457d51   (clean, no -dirty)
    size      466 272 B
    sha256    76fa1ff797a05aee37d50fe2b2ae1c7c7ffb2d57fb97166a1322a9c54f24831d
    Swiss     build/swiss/12-stream/boot.dol  (byte-identical copy)

NO REBUILD IS PERMITTED.  The artifact that was audited is the artifact that
    runs. A rebuild produces a different identity and invalidates §V5.28.1.

NO src/, poc/ OR tools/ CHANGE IS PERMITTED.  R1 and R8 are fixed in
    `stream-0003`, AFTER the first run exists.
```

### What the first run must be read for

**R3 — the draw-done interrupt can preempt the GBP service path.** `IRQ_PI_PEFINISH`
is unmasked by libogc2's `__GX_PEInit` and is never masked by this program, so
`on_draw_done` can land between the ACK and the RE-ARM. It is ≤ 16 instructions
with no loop, no allocation and no device access, at most once per submitted frame
— roughly 6 % of cycles — but it is a new interrupt source `vstate-0004` did not
have. It is visible afterwards as outliers in the per-cycle `t_cause` / `t_ack` /
`t_rearm` records. **Do not call the design timing-safe until that histogram has
been looked at.**

**R8 — the run reports the invariants at its final instant, not throughout.**
`gbp_vpresent_consistent()` is evaluated in the self-test and in the report, and
nowhere during the 30 s capture. `OWNER invariants HOLD` therefore means "held at
end". §V5.28.3 proves no reachable state violates them, so this is defence in
depth rather than a gap in the proof — but the wording over-claims.

The remaining findings (R2, R4, R5, R7) are observability, labelling and one
possible torn field; all are recorded in §V5.28.13 and none blocks a run.

**And the slice position is still what it was: PLAUSIBLE BUT UNMEASURED.** The
re-audit did not change that and did not try to. The measured RE-ARM→next-cause
window is median 42.8 µs with **p25 = 1.9 µs**; the precheck removes the
*already latched* case but not a cause arriving mid-slice, and this code's own
cost has never been measured on hardware. `stream-0002` exists to make that
measurable, not to have settled it.

### What the re-audit settled, so it is not re-derived

- **the one-token rule**, by exhaustive enumeration of a *superset* of the
  program: 705 reachable states, maximum **one** `SUBMITTED` buffer, and no
  main-side write to a buffer the GP owns — with the interrupt permitted between
  any two shared accesses and even with no token armed;
- **the compiler ordering**, PROVEN from `powerpc-eabi-objdump`, not from
  "PowerPC is single-core": both volatile stores retire before `blr`, and
  `GX_SetDrawDone()` sits behind a control dependency on the return value;
- **the libogc2 semantics**, re-read from `external/libogc2` @ `ca03fb75`:
  `GX_SetDrawDone` non-blocking, `GX_DrawDone` blocking,
  `GX_SetDrawDoneCallback` returns the previous callback, `VIDEO_SetNextFramebuffer`
  and `VIDEO_Flush` touch no VI register, and `currentFb` changes in the retrace
  handler at the instant the registers are written;
- **the XFB model**, which corresponds exactly to `currentFb` / `nextFb`;
- **the cache-flush ordering** and **the teardown order**, both in machine code;
- **that the display path really executes**: `on_draw_done` appears once in the
  whole linked image, as its own symbol, with no call site — so `drawdone=1` can
  only have come from the PE FINISH interrupt;
- **the test suite**: 7/7 focused mutations caught, including A1, the exact
  `stream-0001` defect the previous round's suite did **not** catch;
- **build determinism**: the candidate reproduces byte-for-byte from a detached
  worktree at `2457d51` once `GIT_COMMIT`/`GIT_DIRTY` are supplied — inside the
  container a worktree cannot resolve `HEAD`, and the identity string is an input
  to the build.

## Next safe action

**Run the first supervised physical smoke of the exact `stream-0002` artifact**,
under §V5.20 / §V5.21, with the pre-registered R1 identity above applied when the
report is read.

```text
Test ID     GBP-VIDEO-004
Build ID    stream-0002
DOL         build/poc/gbp-video-stream-probe/gbp-video-stream-probe.dol
            466 272 B
            sha256 76fa1ff797a05aee37d50fe2b2ae1c7c7ffb2d57fb97166a1322a9c54f24831d
Swiss       build/swiss/12-stream/boot.dol   (byte-identical copy)
DO NOT      rebuild it, and do not change src/, poc/ or tools/ first.
```

The full operator procedure is in §V5.20; the artifact block is in
"Exact physical artifacts" above.

After that run exists: `stream-0003` with R1 and R8 fixed.

Separately, and required before the experiment can CLOSE rather than before it
runs: the CONTROLLED indexed motion stimulus of §V5.18 still does not exist —
`stimulus/` holds only `agb-color-bars`, the static eight-bar GBP-VIDEO-003 ROM.
A first run can measure service, GX, pacing and the consumer's cost; it **cannot**
measure source-frame loss against ground truth, and must never later be cited as
evidence of zero dropped source frames.

Do **not** implement scaling, aspect correction, filtering, audio playback, A/V
sync, KEYPAD or any network path; do not edit `OGBPCOL1` v1, `tools/vcolor.py`,
`tools/vcolor2.py`, the §V4 contract or any fixture; do not re-label or rebuild
`stream-0001`.

## Do not rediscover

Each of these has sufficient evidence. Re-deriving them wastes a session; if you
believe one is wrong, argue against the source, do not re-run the discovery.

## Do not assume

- **That 5000 ms guarantees the bars are already on screen.** `color-0001`
  showed 5000 ms was *sufficient in that setup* (GBP-HW-120). That is one run on
  one unit with one cartridge, not a boot-time guarantee.
- **That a rebuilt DOL equals the historical physical DOL.** It does not; the
  commit is embedded. Compare hashes.
- **That mGBA closes U-GBP-011.** mGBA knows the GBA's native framebuffer
  format; U-GBP-011 asks what the *Game Boy Player* presents to the GameCube.
  Only the physical GBP-VIDEO-003 run can answer it.
- **That the "pending source" model is FACT.** It is not; U-GBP-033 is open.
- **That the absence of majority-extra in one run proves it cannot happen.**
- **That a longer masked wait is safe** because 5 s was.
- **That `color-0001` became confirmatory once `color-0002` agreed with it.** It
  did not. It failed its own pre-registered gate and stays INCONCLUSIVE
  permanently; `tools/vcolor2.py` still reports it as RETROSPECTIVE.
- **That the closure of U-GBP-011 says anything about bits 1–4 inside a 5-bit
  group.** The stimulus pins bits 0, 5 and 10 individually and each group as a
  set; a permutation fixing those three and rearranging only bits 1–4 is not
  excluded. §V3.19 holds the pattern that would close it, and it is not
  scheduled.
- **That §V5 has been validated by anything.** It was implemented on 2026-09-18
  and the candidate was then REJECTED by its own pre-hardware audit. Nothing has
  run, and its estimates — conversion cost above all — are still explicitly *not*
  budgeted as properties (§V5.22).
- **That a commercial cartridge has been chosen.** §V5.18 records the properties
  one must have and deliberately names no title; the operator owns that choice.
- **That `stream-0001` has been validated on hardware.** It has not run. It is
  implemented and host-validated, no evidence id is allocated to it, and its
  30 s capture duration is still a DESIGN DECISION.
- **That the slice fits.** The argument for one tile row per service cycle rested
  on a misread number. The measured RE-ARM→next-cause idle window is median
  42.8 µs with **p25 = 1.9 µs**; 34 % of cycles have no usable slack at all
  (§V5.26.3). Nothing is lost, because the cause latches, but the placement is
  unmeasured.
- **That `stream-0001` is ready to run.** The pre-hardware audit rejected it:
  one BLOCKER and three HIGH findings (§V5.26). `stream-0002` supersedes it and
  `stream-0001` is never rebuilt or re-labelled.
- **That `stream-0002` is proved because its predecessor's blocker is fixed.**
  The fix is host-validated, Dolphin executes the display path end to end
  including the draw-done callback, and §V5.28 re-audited it and cleared the
  ownership machine by exhaustive enumeration. None of that says anything about
  the device.
- **That `counters DO NOT BALANCE` on a `stream-0002` run means the run failed.**
  It does not. R1 is a **reporting** defect: it makes that line appear on every
  run, off by exactly one, before the capture even opens (§V5.28.10). The
  pre-registered identity is `converted == (presented − SELFTEST.xfb) + overrun`,
  and the raw counters it is computed from remain authoritative.
- **That the audit's DECISION A means nothing was found.** Eight findings were
  recorded (§V5.28.13). A means every *safety* property held: nothing in the
  service path, the ownership machine or the teardown was defective. R1 and R8
  are reporting defects and are fixed in `stream-0003`, after the first run.
- **That `OWNER invariants HOLD` means they held for the whole run.** It means
  they held at the final instant; `gbp_vpresent_consistent()` is never evaluated
  during the capture (R8, §V5.28.16).
- **That the draw-done callback cannot disturb the service path.** `IRQ_PI_PEFINISH`
  is unmasked and is never masked by this program, so it can preempt the ACK →
  RE-ARM window (R3). It is small and bounded, and it is unmeasured.
- **That the slice position is settled.** It is not. The precheck removes the
  *already latched* case; a cause arriving mid-slice is counted, not prevented,
  and the slice's own cost has never been measured on hardware (§V5.27.4).
- **That bytes 0 and 2 are don't-care in general.** §V4 places them outside the
  dependent variable of *this experiment* only. U-GBP-029 is open, they are
  preserved in full, and every run reports the full-raw comparison.

## Raw evidence availability after a clone

Every physical run of this project keeps a **versioned replay fixture** under
`captures/fixtures/`, with the raw device log identified by SHA-256 in the
fixture header. The raw logs themselves live in `logs/` (never versioned) and
`captures/local/` (ignored) — the policy is in `captures/README.md`.

```text
PHYSICAL REPLAY EVIDENCE:  RECOVERABLE FROM A CLONE
RAW TEXT LOG:              NOT STORED IN GIT — IDENTITY PRESERVED BY SHA-256
```

Those are two different things and the distinction matters to anyone verifying a
claim. A fresh clone **does** get, for every physical run: the `.gbpreplay`
replay script, the sidecar binary where the run produced one, and a metadata
header tying both to a DOL hash, a log hash, a size and a commit — enough to
replay the run and recompute the evidence.

A clone **does not** get the original device text log. Those live in `logs/`
(never versioned) and `captures/local/` (ignored), and only their SHA-256 and
size are recorded. A hash does not permit replay; it permits *verification* of a
copy the operator supplies. So a claim traced to a fixture is re-checkable from
a clone alone; a claim traced only to a raw log line is not, until someone
provides the log.

## Swiss operator layout

`make swiss` exports every launchable DOL to `build/swiss/NN-short/boot.dol`
with an `INDEX.txt`, numbered by the versioned manifest
[`tools/swiss-layout.tsv`](../tools/swiss-layout.tsv). Numbers are stable and
never reused; `01-69` are canonical POCs and `80-89` physical diagnostics.

**An exported `boot.dol` gains no physical status by being exported.** It is a
byte-for-byte copy and the authority remains `build/poc/<out_dir>/<dol>`.
Physical status belongs to the exact SHA-256 and commit recorded in
`EVIDENCE.md` / `HARDWARE_TESTS.md` — and `build/swiss/80-prewait/boot.dol` rebuilt at any
commit other than `500429a` is **not** the DOL that ran on hardware.

## Handoff update policy

Update this file when any of these happens:

- a physical run is ingested;
- an evidence status changes;
- an unknown opens or closes;
- a frozen contract is introduced or versioned;
- the active experiment changes;
- the current blocker changes;
- the next safe action changes.

Do **not** update it for a typo, a refactor with no scientific effect, or a
cosmetic build change — unless that change alters an artifact identity that this
file records.

## Canonical resume prompt

Copy this verbatim into any agent to take the project over with no chat history.

```text
You are taking over development/research of the Open-GBP repository.

Do NOT modify anything yet.

First:

1. Read AGENTS.md completely.
2. Read docs/HANDOFF.md completely.
3. Follow the mandatory read order defined there.
4. Verify the repository HEAD and working-tree status.
5. Compare HEAD against the STATE BASELINE COMMIT recorded in docs/HANDOFF.md.
6. If HEAD contains commits newer than that baseline, inspect and reconcile them
   before trusting the "Current scientific state" section.
7. Reconstruct the current scientific state only from repository evidence.

Then report, without changing files:

- current HEAD and whether the tree is clean;
- whether the handoff is current or stale;
- physically established facts;
- corroborated findings;
- open hypotheses and unknowns;
- frozen binary/data-format contracts;
- the exact artifacts that were physically executed, with their hashes;
- the latest physical evidence ingested;
- the current blocker/question;
- the next safe action;
- any contradiction you found between docs/HANDOFF.md and the authoritative
  sources.

Important:

- real physical hardware is the final authority;
- emulator evidence (Dolphin, mGBA) is auxiliary unless the documentation
  explicitly says otherwise;
- do not convert CORROBORATED or HYPOTHESIS into FACT;
- do not claim a rebuilt binary was physically tested merely because the same
  source or variant was: this project embeds the commit in its images, so
  compare the SHA-256 against the recorded one;
- do not change frozen formats silently;
- do not create evidence IDs or physical-validation claims without source
  material;
- do not perform any implementation until you have reported the reconstructed
  state and the operator confirms continuation.

Stop after the takeover report.
```
